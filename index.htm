               <div class="mb-1">My name is Gabriel Barnes and Welcome to my first Portfolio Website!</div>  
                <div class="mb-1">I'm a native Texan, born in Colorado due to the military.  I've had a wide range of work experience ranging from Manufacturing to Retail.</div>  
                <div class="mb-1">My father is a Software Engineer of over twenty years. It is safe to say that I've always been around computers and technology, throughout my entire life, though it has been relatively recent since I decided to pursue a career in Software Development.</div>  
               
               <div class="mb-1">The purpose of this first site is to show what I've learned so far in my first division of studies at MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding.  In this first section, 
                 I've covered basics in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, I've also dabbled in Git and Command line.  </div>
               
              <div class="mb-1"> As for a few of my personal skills and characteristics.  I'll be honest, a lot of this is very new to me, and there will no doubt be a learning curve, I don't have a lot of experience in the Web development field.</div>
                 Yet,  What I do have, however, is the drive to learn and succeed, a thirst for knowledge, a great rapport with people, and many other professional skills and assets.
               
               <div>I hope you find my page interesting and compelling,
               
               Thanks!</div>
